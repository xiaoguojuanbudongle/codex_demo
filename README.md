## Snake Game

A simple terminal-based snake game implemented with Python's `curses` library.

### Running the game

```
python3 snake.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself. Your score increases each time you eat the food (represented by the Ï€ symbol).
